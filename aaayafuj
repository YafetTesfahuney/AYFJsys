# Install Dependencies (Packages)
Once the repository is cloned to your local machine, you'll need to install the required dependencies, which are typically listed in a package.json file if you're working with a Node.js project.

Step 1: Install the required packages
Ensure you're in the project folder (where package.json is located).
Run the following command to install the packages:
cmd
npm install
This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file. It will download all the necessary libraries for your project.

# Run the Project Locally
If your project is a Node.js app, you can start the development server using the following command:

cmd
npm run dev
This will start the app on a local server (usually at http://localhost:3000 or another specified port). You can then open your browser and check the project running locally.

# Commit and Push Changes to GitHub (If Needed)
If you make changes to the project and want to push them back to GitHub:

Step 1: Stage your changes
*cmd
git add .
Step 2: Commit the changes
cmd
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Step 3: Push the changes to the GitHub repository
* cmd
git push origin main
Replace main with the appropriate branch name if necessary.
